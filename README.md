# EJS-Partials-Practice
This is a sample portfolio website built using Bootstrap, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript). The primary purpose of this application is to serve as a proof of concept (POC) for utilizing EJS, specifically focusing on EJS partials.

## Features:
* EJS Partials: The application demonstrates the use of EJS partials by keeping the header and footer common for all pages. These partials are stored in a dedicated folder within the codebase.

* Bootstrap Integration: Bootstrap CDN is utilized within the application for styling and layout purposes, providing a modern and responsive design to the portfolio website.
